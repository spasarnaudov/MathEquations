# MathEquations

MathEquations is an Android application designed to help users practice and enhance their math skills through a variety of equations. The app currently supports four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each operation comes with unique filters like "Addition By Passing The Tenth" and "Exact Division" to tailor the difficulty and focus of the practice sessions.
